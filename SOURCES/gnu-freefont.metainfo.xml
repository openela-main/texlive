  <summary>A Unicode font, with rather wide coverage</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      The package provides a set of outline (i.e. OpenType) fonts covering 
      as much as possible of the Unicode character set. The set consists of 
      three typefaces: one monospaced and two proportional (one with uniform 
      and one with modulated stroke).
